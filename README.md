This is a java library that implements a datastructure I consider to be missing in the java landscape.

Blog post 
=========
A bit more background about this datastructure and how it works can be found in this blog which I wrote about it: [https://techlab.bol.com/finding-the-longest-matching-string-prefix-fast/](https://partnerprogramma.bol.com/click/click?p=1&t=url&s=2171&f=TXL&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechlab.bol.com%2Ffinding-the-longest-matching-string-prefix-fast%2F&name=prefixmap)
